## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Cristian Avelar-Romero, and I am a first-generation Latino Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with hands-on experience in product verification, mechanical design, and real-world engineering applications. Through internships at Honda Development & Manufacturing of America and Engineers In Action, I have applied data-driven analysis, root-cause problem solving, and hands-on fabrication to improve system performance, reliability, and efficiency. My interests lie in quality and reliability testing, manufacturing, and mechanical design across a wide range of industries, including—but not limited to—automotive systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of analysis, testing, and hands-on fabrication to ensure products meet high standards of performance, safety, and durability. I am motivated by building reliable, efficient, and impactful solutions, and I bring a collaborative mindset, strong technical foundation, and a commitment to continuous learning.
